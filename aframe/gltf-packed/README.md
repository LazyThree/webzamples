Created for [this SO thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65367877/how-do-i-get-a-gltfpack-processed-model-to-appear-in-a-frame)

The component from index.js mimics the original `gltf-model` but is able to gltf models packed with the [meshoptimizer](https://github.com/zeux/meshoptimizer/tree/master/gltf).

There are two examples:
* [examples/packed_vs_nonpacked](https://gftruj.github.io/webzamples/aframe/gltf-packed/examples/packed_vs_nonpacked.html) with a gltf model and the same one but packed
* [examples/animated_nonpacked](https://gftruj.github.io/webzamples/aframe/gltf-packed/examples/animated_nonpacked.html) with an non-packed animated model, just for testing purposes.
